                <section>
                    <h2 class="heading-2" id="sec1">The Project</h2>
                    <p class="body-copy">
                        <em>“Think Hearthstone, but three players against one”.</em>
                        That was roughly how the game was pitched to me by Casper Hoegalmen. 
                        He had worked on the game as a prototype <a href="https://www.casperhoegalmen.com/realmlord-asymmetrical-card-game-1" target="_blank">for about two years</a>, and was now looking to use the project to get some further experience as a game producer.
                        Even for a prototype, this was a very ambitious project.
                        On top of that, we had a two months deadline. 
                        But we were a bunch of motivated people with some freetime during the summer, and a passion for making games.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="heading-3">The Team</h3>
                    <p class="body-copy">
                        The team was quite small considering the scope of the project. 
                        We had our game producer, who was in charge of making sure the project was on track, and two teams - the art team and the programming team. 
                        The programming team consisted of a UI programmer, three backend programmers, and one networking programmer. 
                        On the other team, the art team, we had two UI artists as well as one concept artist, and myself as UI designer and team lead. 
                        Music & sound effects were going to be covered by someone outside our team. 
                        Our level of skill ranged from novice to intermediate, but all of us were excited to work together and develop our skills.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="heading-3">The Goal</h3>
                    <p class="body-copy">
                        Of course the underlying goal of the project was to deliver a playable prototype of a card game, but there was a different, underlying goal. 
                        From the beginning it was made clear that the project was a way for each of us to improve on our respective skillsets.
                        Making the prototype was just a means toward that end - getting a sense of how it is to work as a team to deliver a game within a set deadline. 
                        The project was not intended to become anything more than what we could do during the two months, but we did aim for releasing a playable prototype on the itch.io games platform.
                    </p>
                    <p class="body-copy">
                        Personally, one of my goals was become better at photoshop, and skeuomorphic UI design. 
                        That is, having the visual part of the UI resemble physical objects, which could belong in the game setting.
                        This was the first time I tried my hand at that, and I almost declined working on the project because I thought my work wouldn't be good enough.
                        But I am glad I got convinced otherwise, because even though the visual aspect of the UI is not the most impressive, it was only one part of what got to contribute with.

                <section>
                    <h2 class="heading-2" id="sec2">My Role</h2>
                    <p class="body-copy">
                        Being the UI designer as art lead art lead, I had two different roles. 
                        As the UI designer, I had to figure out the best way to communicate game information to players, using graphics and sound. 
                        As the art lead on the other hand, I had to define the aesthetic vision of the game together with the rest of the team, and I had to make sure that we could deliver. 
                        This meant I had to understand the capabilities and personal goals of my team members, and take the game in a direction that was feasible. 
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="heading-3">The Challenges</h3>
                    <p class="body-copy">
                        We lacked an artist to work on the in game environment, with aspects such as lighting, 3D modelling and 2D textures, which make up a big part of the game’s visual appeal. 
                        Apart from that, we only had one concept artist to work on the art for the 80 or so distinct cards in the game. 
                        This made it a challenge to deliver something polished, with a visual appeal, even though it was just a prototype. 
                        Our solution was to leverage our lack of resources and make the game’s aesthetic around the what we had.
                    </p>
                    <p class="body-copy">
                        From the outset of the project, the game had actually been worked on for around 2 years. 

                        This initial prototype which had been tested, was made using <a href="https://www.tabletopsimulator.com/" target="blank">Tabletop Simulator</a>. 

                        In this prototype, abstract tokens were used to communicate information to players, and keep track of the game’s complex rules. 

                        My job was to figure out the best way to communicate information to players, and what that might look and sound like.  

                        This meant figuring out how to communicate the rules of the game, quite a few of which are novel and therefore had to be learned initially (by myself as well). 
                        I had to map out the different states in the game, and consider feedforward for available actions the players can take, as well as feedback from the game.
                    </p>
                    <p class="body-copy">
                        Regarding the game design, the three-against-one aspect meant that the game was <em>unbalanced</em>, which also poses a design challenge.
                        The game design and the work still left to be done was one of the main factors compelling me to join the project.
                        I wanted to understand the purpose of each rule, and how it could be optimised - made simpler to understand. 
                        It was like a lot of interacting variables, which had to fit together.
                        Tweeking one rule had the potential to break other parts of the game.

                <section>
                    <h2 class="heading-2" id="sec3">The Creative Process</h2>
                    <p class="body-copy">
                        I like to think about design (and creative processes in general) as working with different constraints. 
                        By constraints, I mean the underlying considerations which inform the direction of the design. 
                        As an example, when trying to implement a new diet, you might think about nutrition, affordability and time, as the main factors determining what might be an acceptable choice of a food item. 
                        Identifying these parameters helps by narrowing down the problemspace. 
                        Since constraints are sometimes conflicting (which is common in creative processes), finding the right balance requires strategic consideration and some trial and error. 
                        I find that the best way to work with constraints is to first identify as many as possible and then work as abstract and quickly as possible, going through different  ideas - different configurations of how the constraints might be fulfilled. 
                        During this process, constraints are weighted in importance and new ones are discovered, as you learn more about the problem.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="heading-3">Constraints</h3>
                    <p class="body-copy">
                        What makes constraints useful is also what makes them hard to work with. 
                        They help by narrowing down the problemspace.
                        When you make a decision, it has to satisfy all the constraints - fit within the whole.
                        If you discover a new constraint, previous design choices you've made might not satisfy it.
                    </p>
                    <p class="body-copy">
                        In the context of this project, screen space was one of the highest weighted constraining factors. 
                        This was something I had to be aware of from the very beginning. 
                        I had to make sure I knew all the rules of the game which had to be conveyed graphically, so that I could allocate the adequate space for it in the design. 
                        More than once, I discovered a new rule which had to be conveyed, and I had to adjust the design accordingly. 
                        Sometimes this meant I had to scrap a previous design for a UI component, since there was no longer space for it. 
                        Having to go back and try something different, is not uncommon when undertaking a creative endeavour.
                        However, being careul about not getting too concrete with early designs and rushing to choices is an exercise in skill - a skill I got to improve on during this project.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="heading-3">Player Resources</h3>
                    <p class="body-copy">
                        One example of this was when I was considering how to represent the players’ resources - mana and health. 
                        I had the idea of going with the style of gothic RPGs and use orbs which contained a liquid and a number - both letting the player know how much of the corresponding resource they had available. 
                        It all started out according to the textbook, sketching on paper at first. 
                    </p>
                    <figure>
                        <span class="icon-close close"></span>
                        <img class="fullscreen-able" src="../resources/ascendant-games/ascendant-resources.jpg" alt="player resources sketch">
                        <figcaption>Different ideas on how to represent player resources. The two main considerations for choosing a design was size and aesthetic.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p class="body-copy">
                        Then I started elaborating the design in Figma, and exploring how to represent “shared mana” - one of the game’s novelty rules. 
                        After a good amount of time and after creating different designs, I realised that the idea was inherently flawed. In gothic RPGs, mana and health is typically counted in the hundreds, thousands and even millons. 
                        In our game, we only had to work with a range of perhaps 0 to 40. 
                        In the case of mana, you start the game with as low as two. 
                        I had discovered a constraint which might be thought of as “the graphical representation of player resources should fit the range of numbers” - and the design didn't fit.

                    <h3 class="heading-3">Shared Mana</h3>
                    <p class="body-copy">
                        Shared mana is one of the novelties in the game, which encourages teamplay between the allies.
                        If no unit has been played in a lane since the beginning of the round, that lane contains mana.
                        A player will then unlock that mana by playing a unit in that lane, and can use that mana up front.
                        If the mana is not used up front, it is added to a shared mana pool between the allies.
                        Having this shared mana system adds a level of strategy as the players have to consider playing their cards in a certain way.
                        They also have to talk together, in order to find out who should use the mana.

                        I had to consider how to show the shared mana in the UI.
                        For a while, the idea was to show the shared mana at each ally, since this is were the other resources are displayed.
                        But this was not consistent with the fact that the mana is shared between players, and not individual.
                        The solution was to use one UI element for the shared mana pool, and have that element next to the player you play as.

                    <p class="body-copy">
                        My approach to the screen space constraints was to establish a visual hierarchy and decide which information is most important, and therefore should take up the most screen space.
                        I looked at other digital card games to see how the problem had been solved before, which I find important when working on any problem.
                        I remembered a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YISKcRDcDJg&t=1186s&ab_channel=GDC" target="_blank">GDC Talk</a> I had seen on the subject, and decided to give it a rewatch. 
                        The talk by Zach Gage is on building games that can be understood at a glance, with the main take away that the visual hierarchy should be seperated into three distinct levels of importance.
                        He calls it <em>The Three Reads</em>. 
                        The first read is what you see at first, and should ideally describe the core gameplay - what kind of game it is.
                        The second read is for unintuitive rules - rules which are novel and unique to the game, and therefore have to be learned.
                        Finally, the third read is for contextual rules, and should take up the least space.
                        Using this rule of thumb, I created a list containing a description of the UI components, sorted in three levels based on how important they were to the game.
                        <ul class="body-copy">
                            <em>First read</em>
                            <li>The players' hand</li>
                            <li>The battlefield, containing the units.</li>
                            <em>Second read</em>
                            <li>The 'End Round' button</li>

                            <li>Menu button</li>
                            <li>..And everything else</li>

                        <p class="body-copy">
                            The first read tells the player that is it a strategic card game. 
                            They see the cards, and the units on the board, indicating that it is some kind of card game / stategy game hybrid.
                            Then they notice the four different players, and that there are three players on one team, and only one on the other, but who seems to have some more options available.
                            It is also during the second read that they spot the timer and end round button - the game is turn based with a real time component.
                            Then all the rest follows in the third and final read.

                    <p class="body-copy">
                        The nature of the game meant that there would be three lanes - one for each player on the <em>ally</em> team.  
                        Each lane would have an <em>ally</em> side and an <em>overlord</em> side, each side with 2 rows. 
                        Each of these rows can contain up to four units. 
                        This means that 48 units should be able to be displayed on the battlefield when each spot has been taken. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="body-copy">        
                        Each of these units should of course also have their attack and defence stats displayed.
                        Since the game has a resistance/damage type system, this had to be communicated as well.
                    </p>

                        Furthermore, when in combat, <em>teammate</em>, <em>self</em> and <em>enemy</em> should be differentiated, as well as the state of the unit - can it attack or not? Or in case of enemy units, can it be attacked?  
                        On top of this, certain keyword effects should also be displayed - perhaps the unit is weaker or stronger due to some permanent effect. 
                        These are some of the decisions I will go over now.

                    <h3 class="heading-3">Perspective & Representing Units</h3>
                    <p class="body-copy">
                        The first decision that had to be made, which would inform later decisions, was how to represent the battlefield.
                        We knew that there was going to be three straight lanes, with the the allies on one side and the overlord on the other.
                        From here we narrowed it down to two options, having an orthographic camera, or going with perspective.
                        On one hand, going with perspective would support the feel we were going for - we wanted the game to feel like a battle taking place between the overlord and the three allies.
                        Using a perspective camera would help towards this end, as it would feel more life-like than having an othographic camera.
                        On the other hand, it would also mean that the units would become smaller the farther they are away from the camera, which would not be ideal.
                    </p>

                    <p class="body-copy">
                        In the end, we went with a perspective camera.
                        Units on the battlefield were not going to look like cards, as in other card games.
                        Instead the silhouette of the artwork would be used to represent the unit on the battlefield - inspired by cardboard cutouts one might use for table top RPGs.
                        The reasoning behind this, was again to support the feel of being on a battlefield. 
                        We felt like having cards on the battlefield took away from this feeling, and this was the chance to do something new.
                        Silhouettes also played into our limited time and manpower - it was easier to implement. 
                        We reused the art that was going on the cards for the silhuettes and circumventet having to make 3D models, or something similar.
                    </p>
                    <p class="body-copy">
                        We still wanted the units take up the same amount of screenspace, something an othographic camera accomplishes, but not one in perspective.
                        So, the UI programmers made a script, which made the units face the camera as well as resizing them based on the distance from it.

                    <h3 class="heading-3">Unit Resistances & Damage Types</h3>
                    <p class="body-copy">
                        The concept of unit resistances and the encompassing damage system posed another challenge.
                        There are two types of resistances - <em>physical</em> and <em>magical</em>.
                        A unit with physical resistance takes less damage from a source which deals physical damage, depending on how much resistance the defending unit has.
                        The same goes for magical resistance.
                        On top of that, there is a damage type called <em>true</em>, which ignores resistance types.
                    </p>
                    <p class="body-copy">
                        This resistance system had to be communicated in some way, to the player.
                        In fact, in the Tabletop Simulator prototype, it was a known issue that the system was not expressed clearly.
                        As a result, players would become confused when attacking with a unit, dealing less damage than they had expected.
                        That prototype relied on a colour coding system - red means physical, blue magical, and orange for true.

                    <p class="body-copy">
                        My inital idea was to make icons, representing physical, magical and true damage/resistance.
                        But the idea was scratched, as it simply looked to noisy, when looking at the battlefield, with 48 units.

                    <p class="body-copy">
                        In addition, there was an aspect to the resistance/damage system which I hadn't considered.
                        Cards could have both types of resistances at the same time.
                        Also, some cards didn't have resistances at all, and this also had to be communicated.
                        The solution was to back to a colour coding system, and try to express it more clearly.
                        It was also clear, that displaying the resistances of units in detail on the battlefield, would not be an option.
                        It was simply too much information. 
                        Instead, players would have to hover on the unit to reveal its details.

                    <p class="body-copy">
                        A unit has different attributes which had to be indicated. 
                        Some units can attack, while others cannot. 
                        Since the allies can play their units in the same lane, there had to be a visual seperation between who controls which units.
                        Furthermore, during different states of the game, different information becomes important.
                        When deciding which unit to attack with, for example, you want to see which units can attack.
                        When having selected a unit to attack with, there should be some feedback that you have indeed selected the unit, and some indication of which units you can attack - percieved affordance. 
                        Going through the different states and how to represent them was a team effort.
                        We looked to how other games have solved this problem, we sketched different ideas for visuals, and we created a list of what needed to be indicated.

                    <p class="body-copy">
                        Auditory feedback is very important for a game, for communicating events as well as for adding a level of enjoyment.

                        We had an out-of-house musician, who had already made some soundtracks, and was going to create the sound effects (SFX).

                        I had to make a detailed list of the sound effects, prioritise them, and coordinate with the sound designer.

                        I started by brainstorming the different actions and states in the game which needed auditory feedback, and had the team look over it, to see if they had anything to add.

                        By the end I had a list on the blackboard, with some items put into categories, according to their function in the game.

                        I decided on the different categories and wrote up the entire thing in Figma, where I also prioritised it according to three levels of importance.

                    <p class="body-copy">
                        I wrote a description for each SFX in order to give the artist an idea of what I was going for.
                        
                        To get an estimate of how long it would take to implement the sound effects, I talked to one of the programmers.

                        I then added some documentation about the prioritisation, and suggested a timeframe for making the effects.

                        We were at the very end of the project, with a couple of weeks left, so the plan was to have the 'crucial' effects done and hopefully some of the 'important' ones.
                        
                        At the initial meeting with the sound designer, we discussed the effects and their descriptions as well as the timeframe.

                        We agreed that he would deliver the SFX within a couple of days.

                        During the last week of the project, we couldn't get a hold of the sound designer.

                        Since I have experience with digital audio workstations, my producer asked me if I could make the effects.

                        I knew what had to be made, and an idea of what I wanted it to sound like, and at this point I had handed over the UI assets.

                        On the last day of the project I recorded some audio, did some editing, processing and created most of the sound effects from priorities 1 and 2.

                        You can give them a listen here below.

                    <p class="body-copy">
                        As lead for the art team, I was responsible for defining the visual direction for each effect, make sure that we were on track, and keep our producer in the loop.

                        Our producer already had a good idea of which effects he would like in the game, which was a good start, because the rest of us had yet to become familiar with the specific cards.

                    <h3 class="heading-3">The Initial Process</h3>
                    <p class="body-copy">
                        The team started the process of defining the different effects with a brainstorm, coming up with ideas of what each effect could look like.

                        We also brainstormed ideas for indicating things like unit states, and what the environment in the game might look like.

                        During the first couple of days of the project, many ideas where externalised, either through sketches or dialog. 
                        
                        Exploring these ideas lead to many of the decisions we made regarding the game, including not only visuals but game design and how the game was going to be implemented.  
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3 class="heading-3">Working Agile</h3>
                    <p class="body-copy">
                        After our producer had prioritised the effects and assigned them to sprints, I got together with the art team to brainstorm ideas for the effects, work out who would make what, and how long it would take.

                        In some cases we already had different ideas as a starting point, from our initial brainstorm.

                        After coordinating with the team I would get back to the producer to let him know what we agreed on, and he would adjust the sprint, if necessary.

                        This process was repeated at the beginning of each sprint, each of which lasting about two weeks.

                        Progress was tracked in our project management software.

                    <p class="body-copy">
                        Casper had a list of all the cards.
                        The were continually revised throughtout the project, and some were cut, due to time constraints.
                        We had about 80 cards in total, and one artist.
                        We discussed how we should go about it - should he create a couple of cards polished, and the rest more sketchy, or should he do all in the same quality.
                        We let the decision be up to him, and his personal goals.
                        He ended up doing all in the same quality.
                        He would do 5 cards in sketches and we would get together to review, and note any changes.
                        At the last part of the project, he would then make the cards polished, based on the notes.
