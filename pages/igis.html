                            During the summer of 2020, I focused on two things. 
                            I had joined a game developer team as UI Designer, working on a prototype for the game <a href="ascendant-games.html">Realm Lords</a>,
                            and I had started a new job hunting campaign - contacting companies and arranging so-called coffee meetings.
                        </p>
                        <p class="body-copy">
                            The goal for these coffee meetings were get to know the different companies, 
                            learn where I should put my focus and energy,  
                            and - if everything went well - land an internship as UX/UI designer by the end of the summer.
                        </p>
                        <p class="body-copy">
                            My first meeting that summer was with I-GIS, a company which specialises in developing geographical information systems (GIS).
                            I had an online meeting with the CEO, which went very well. It was very exciting hearing about the kind of work the company does, and since they didn't already have a designer, it seemed like a great opportunity to show the value in having one. By the end of the meeting we got to talk about a potential internship, and I ended up starting in late september. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="body-copy">
                            This case is about my work on a WebGIS for the website FlyFotosDK, which was my main focus during the internship.

                        <p class="body-copy">
                            FlyFotos WebGIS is a web-based solution for displaying aerial photos of Denmark, with full coverage of the country dating back to the 1940’s and continuing all the way to 2000.
                            The primary customer segment for the product is the public sector, as well as other organisations which hold an interest in the history of a specific area.
                            It can be used for purposes such as land restoration, inspecting for potential pollution, city development and coastal management.
                            Then there are users who use the product during their leisure, in relation to their hobbies, and users who are just trying it out of curiosity.
                        </p>
                        <p class="body-copy">
                            In addition to a WebGIS, a WMS (Web Maps Service) is offered through the site, which is tailed to the customer’s individual needs. 
                            The customer receives custom-made access, based on the specific maps they wish to use.
                            This access is facilitated by a URL link, which can be imported into other GIS software.
                        </p>
                        <p class="body-copy">
                            The main focus of FlyFotos WebGIS, is to act as an easy-to-use, simple way of viewing the different maps, without too many expert features (at least in the beginning).
                            Instead, the customer will use the WMS and use their own GIS, if needed.
                            Smaller clients, or clients with fewer needs, may wish to use the WebGIS if they do not already have a GIS within the company.

                            When I started my internship, the project was already underway. 
                            It was based on an earlier product and used much of the same functionality, but the visual design needed to be updated. 
                            As there was no other designer at the company I really had the opportunity to show what I could do.

                        <!-- <p class="body-copy">
                            I-GIS is a smaller company, so I quickly became familiar with my colleagues. 
                            I was situated in one of the offices, which usually houses four developers.
                            My desk was right next to the Web Developer on the project, which was convenient, as it made communication easy. I could quickly ask if there was something I didn’t know, or if I wanted to share an idea.    
                        </p> -->
                        <!-- <p class="body-copy">
                            Since I had a lot to learn about FlyFotosDK GIS systems in general, I spent some time talking with my colleagues.
        
                            I find that as a designer, you are a mediator in the sense that you gather as much information as you can, from colleagues, stakeholders and users, and use that information to inform the design.
        
                            Apart from the web developer, I worked closely with two of my colleagues who are consultants on FlyFotosDK.
                        </p> -->
                        <p class="body-copy">
                            To start off, I talked to everyone at the office about the existing design, to find out how it could be improved. 
                            I then did some testing with two of my new colleagues, who weren't too familiar with the product.
                            This was important, as I wanted to see how a person would experience the product for the first time.
                            If I tested with someone who was familiar with the product, their conceptual model would have been informed by their use of the product - they would have become used to suboptimal aspects of the design.
                        </p>
                        <p class="body-copy">
                            After the tests I wrote down some notes, about what could be improved in the new version.
                            It was only a few things relating to system feedback, but the tests also gave me a better understanding of the product.
    
                            With this new knowledge I created a list of use cases:
                            <ul class="body-copy">
                                <em>The user wants to...</em> 
                                <li>find a specific location on the map.</li>
                                <li>compare two maps, e.g. from two different time periods.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
    
                        <p class="body-copy">
                            This is captures the typical use of the product, in broad strokes. 
                            In most cases, the user has a specific location in mind, which they would like to inspect.
                            For example, they might want to see what the area looked like in the past, to see if there is some indication of potential pollution.
                            Some users might explore the map without a specific location in mind, but since these users are most likely not paying customers, this was not a primary concern.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p class="body-copy">
                            I then made a list of the different interactions with the system, which would lead to fulfilling the beforementioned goals:
                            <ul class="body-copy">
                                <em>The user can...</em>
                                <li>Use a search function to find a specific location on the map.</li>
                                <li>Use a search function to find a specific map.</li>
                                <li>Navigate the maps by clicking and dragging to pan, and scrolling to zoom.</li>
                                <li>Use navigation controls for zooming.</li>
                                <li>Double click to zoom in on an area.</li>
                                <li>Zoom directly to specific map, by double clicking on the card name</li>
                                <li>Zoom directly to a specific map, by clicking on a zoom-to-map icon.</li>
                                <li>Show or hide cards using a layer manager.</li>
                                <li>Filter cards using meaningful categories.</li>
                                <li>Turn 'only show maps visible in viewport' on and off (for hiding maps not related to the currently zoomed-to area).</li>
                                <li>Change the opacity of the visible maps.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p class="body-copy">
                            Most of these functions were already implemented in the old GIS (and the list was based on the functions in that GIS, to a large degree). 
                            It provided a good checklist for making sure the functions would be implemented, and it also prompted thinking about how the graphical interface could facilitate some of these interactions.

                            Functionally, the design was going to be similar to the exisiting one, so most of the changes I made was related to the visual design, and making the product follow the same visual identity as the website.
                            The layer manager was the biggest part of the design, so I chose to focus on that.

                            I quickly realised that keeping a clear visual heirarchy would be the biggest challenge.
                            This was also restated by my colleagues, who reminded me of the fact that the layer manager could contain several hundred maps at once.
                            This made the project a good exercise in using whitespace, fonts and colours in order to seperate the different information presented to the user.

                        <p class="body-copy">
                            I also found that the icons needed to be updated. 
                            Checkboxes and toggle switches seemed to general, and didn't look to slick when having multiple items in the layer manager.

                            When posed with a specific design challenge, I like to make different versions in order to learn more and see what works the best.
                            This project was no exception, and there was a lot of decisions which came up.
                            For example what changing the opacity of a map would look like:
                        </p>

                        <p class="body-copy">
                            Adding a text description and fine control:

                        <p class="body-copy">
                            Creating and comparing different variations in this way was my process for making some of the bigger decisions in the design.
                            It was also a great way to get feedback from others - it is easier to describe what you like or dislike about a design, if you can point to a different version.

                            This process also prompted me to think about how the user would interact with the system, leading to new considerations and subsequent changes to the design.

                        <p class="body-copy">
                            As mentioned previously, updating the icons was another big focus of this case.
                            I was exicted to work with icons, since icons for the web was a topic I had wanted to explore for a while. 
                            I had read a little about the subject, since I used some icons on my personal website, but not enough to warrant the use of a system.
                            So far, I had just used inline SVGs, which kind of bothered me, since they were tedious to keep track of and reuse.
                            But with FlyFotos WebGIS, I had the opportunity to explore the topic of icon systems some more, since I had to create a bunch of icons which should be easy for the developer to implement.
                   
                        </p>
    
                        <p class="body-copy">
                            I decided on implementing an icon font, which seemed slick and easy to implement, and because I wasn't too sold on approaches.
                            An icon font system also seemed in line with how the developer already worked with icons.

                        <p class="body-copy">
                            The idea behind an icon font is pretty clever. You create a custom font, where each glyph represents an icon. 
                            Then you can simply write the code for the specific glyph (icon) you want to use, or you can use some CSS magic to make classes for each icon. 
                            Doing the latter, you just have to make a span element and give it the corresponding class.
                            You also get icons which are easy to style, and to size. 
                            Since the icon is practically a font, you can use the font-size CSS property to set its size. 
                            Similarly, you can use the color property to color it. No more fill or stroke for styling an SVG.

                            In order to make the process of creating an icon font simpler, there are some different tools. 
                            I chose the first one I came across, <a href="https://icomoon.io/app/" target="_blank">Icomoon</a>, which seemed to work fine.
                            I just had to export my icons from my design system in Figma, upload them to Icomoon, make some adjustments and download the font. 
                            Then the font file and CSS stylesheet can be linked in the HTML, and the icons are ready to use.

                        <p class="body-copy">
                            Following the first week, I had the design down in broad strokes, so I turned my focus to how the design could support the user journey of becoming a customer.
    
                            In a general sense, how the user could get informed about the different licenses, and sign up for an account.
    
                            At the time, there was a consensus that there were three types of customers - private, business and private premium. 
    
                        </p>
                        <p class="body-copy">
                            As a private citizen without an account, you would be able to use the product for free, and instead be shown advertisements.
                            The premium users on the other hand, would get rid of the ads and unlock more features.
                            Lastly, the business customers would have to pay in order to get an account, based on the number of users within the company.
                        </p>
                        <p class="body-copy">
                            Early on, I tried to support these three types of customers, but somewhere during my last two weeks, I had become sceptical of the second type of customer.
    
                            I suddenly had a hard time imagining that a private citizen would use the product so extensively, that they would want to create an account.
    
                            The small amount of potential customers in this segment, together with the costs of getting up a payment service, seemed to outweigh the potential income.
    
                            In the end, the design for making an account focused solely on B2B customers and free to use for private customers (with ads).
                        </p>
                        <p class="body-copy">
                            In this part of the design phase, I had to think about:
                            <ul class="body-copy">
                                <li>How to inform users that it is free to use as a private citizen</li>
                                <li>How to inform users that they have to create an account, if they are going to use the product for business</li>
                                <li>The flow of entering the website, read about the product and service, create an account and use the product</li>
                                <li>Opportunities for getting users to sign up from the WebGIS</li>
    
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p class="body-copy">
                            I added a button for accessing the user's account. 
                            If the was not signed in when clicking the button, they would be prompted to sign in or to sign up. 
                            This provided a new channel for getting customers for the product.

                            When signed in, clicking the button would copy the WMS URL to the user's clipboard and prompt a feedback message.
                            If the user is not signed in, or the if the account doesn't have a WMS connected to it, clicking the button would instead show the user two options:
                            read more about the service, or receive an offer.

                            Designing how the user would sign up for an account using the website was important for the user experience too, eventhough it was not part of the WebGIS UI.
                            I had to figure out how to redirect leisure users to the webGIS, and business users through a sign up funnel.
                            Through some iterations with the help of my two colleagues who were consultants on FlyFotosDK, we reached this design:

                            The demo was held online, over Teams and took 30 minutes.
                            There was some good, actionable feedback, which prompted some changes to the design, relating to the consistency of icons and the conceptual model of how the search function should work.

                            The first week of the internship was the most exciting.
                            There was a lot to learn, and a lot of possibilities to explore in the design.
                            It was hard putting down work during my 1 hour and 20 minutes train ride back home, even though I had allocated this time to work on my portfolio and applying for jobs.
                            During the second week, I felt that I had most of the design done, and things started to slow down.
                            I looked to other things that could get my drive back, like it was during the first week.
                            Being able to tie a knot on a project and deliver is something I came to terms with, that I have to do, even though I do not find it fun in the same way, as exploring different designs.
                            But after making the switch, cleaning up the design document, finishing the different prototypes and downloading the last version of the iconfont, was satisfying in its own way.
