                    <p class="body-copy">
                        During the summer of 2020, I focused on two things. 
                        I had joined a game developer team as UI Designer, working on a prototype for the game <a href="../Pages/realm-lords.html">Realm Lords</a>,
                        and I had started a new job hunting campaign - contacting companies and arranging so-called coffee meetings.
                    </p>
                    <p class="body-copy">
                        The goal for these coffee meetings were get to know the different companies, 
                        learn where I should put my focus and energy,  
                        and - if everything went well - land an internship as UX/UI designer by the end of the summer.
                    </p>
                    <p class="body-copy">
                        My first meeting that summer was with I-GIS, a company which specialises in developing geographical information systems (GIS).
                        I had an online meeting with the CEO, which went very well. It was very exciting hearing about the kind of work the company does, and since they didn't already have a designer, it seemed like a great opportunity to show the value in having one. By the end of the meeting we got to talk about a potential internship, and I ended up starting in late september. 
                        During my internship I mainly worked on a WebGIS for the website FlyFotosDK, which this case is about.

                    <h2 class="heading-2" id="sec2">The Product</h2>
                    <p class="body-copy">
                        FlyFotos WebGIS is a web-based solution for displaying aerial photos of Denmark, with full coverage dating back to the 1940’s all the way to 2000.
                        The primary customer segment for the product is the public sector and other organisations which have interest in the history of a specific area.
                        Its uses include land restoration, inspecting for potential pollution, city development and coastal management.
                        Then there are also users who are private citizens and hobbyists.
                    </p>
                    <p class="body-copy">
                        In addition to FlyFotos WebGIS, FlyFotosDK provides a WMS (Web Maps Service), which is tailed to the customer’s individual needs. 
                        The customer receives a custom-made access, based on the specific maps they wish to use.
                        This acces is provided through a URL link, which can be imported into other GIS software.
                    </p>
                    <p class="body-copy">
                        The main focus of FlyFotos WebGIS, is to act as an easy-to-use, simple way of viewing the different maps, without too many expert features.
                        Instead, the customer will use the WMS and use their own GIS, if needed.
                        Smaller clients, or clients with fewer needs may wish to use the WebGIS if they do not already a GIS within the company.

                    <h2 class="heading-2">Approach</h2>
                    <p class="body-copy">
                        When I started my internship, the project was already underway. 
                        It was based on an earlier product and used much of the same functionality, but the visual design needed to be updated. 
                        As there was no other designer at the company I really had the opportunity to show what I could do. 
                    </p>    
                    <!-- <p class="body-copy">
                        I-GIS is a smaller company, so I quickly became familiar with my colleagues. 
                        I was situated in one of the offices, which usually houses four developers.
                        My desk was right next to the Web Developer on the project, which was convenient, as it made communication easy. I could quickly ask if there was something I didn’t know, or if I wanted to share an idea.    
                    </p> -->
                    <!-- <p class="body-copy">
                        Since I had a lot to learn about FlyFotosDK GIS systems in general, I spent some time talking with my colleagues.
    
                        I find that as a designer, you are a mediator in the sense that you gather as much information as you can, from colleagues, stakeholders and users, and use that information to inform the design.
    
                        Apart from the web developer, I worked closely with two of my colleagues who are consultants on FlyFotosDK.
                    </p> -->
                    <p class="body-copy">
                        To start off, I talked to everyone at the office about the existing design, to find out how it could be improved. 
                        I then did some testing with two of my new colleagues, who weren't too familiar with the product.
                        This was important, as I wanted to see how a person would experience the product for the first time.
                        If I tested with someone who was familiar with the product, their conceptual model would have been informed by their use of the product. 
                        In other words, they would have become used to some suboptimal aspects of the design.
                    </p>
                    <p class="body-copy">
                        I then created a list of use cases:
                        <ul class="body-copy">
                            <em style="line-height: 200%;">The user wants to...</em> 
                            <li>find a specific location on the map.</li>
                            <li>compare two maps, e.g. from two different time periods.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p class="body-copy">
                        I then made a list of the different interactions with the system, which would lead to fulfilling these goals:
                        <ul class="body-copy">
                            <em style="line-height: 200%;">The user can...</em>
                            <li>Use a search function to find a specific location on the map.</li>
                            <li>Use a search function to find a specific map.</li>
                            <li>Navigate the maps by clicking and dragging to pan, and scrolling to zoom.</li>
                            <li>Use navigation controls for zooming.</li>
                            <li>Double click to zoom in on an area.</li>
                            <li>Zoom directly to specific map, by double clicking on the card name</li>
                            <li>Zoom directly to a specific map, by clicking on a zoom-to-map icon.</li>
                            <li>Show or hide cards using a layer manager.</li>
                            <li>Filter cards using meaningful categories.</li>
                            <li>Turn 'only show maps visible in viewport' on and off (for hiding maps not related to the currently zoomed-to area).</li>
                            <li>Change the opacity of the visible maps.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p class="body-copy">
                        Most of these functions were already implemented in the old GIS (and the list was based on the functions in that GIS, to some degree). 
                        The list provided a good sanity check, to make sure that the new design met all the criteria. 
                    </p>

                <section>
                    <h2 class="heading-2">Design</h2>
                    <p class="body-copy">
                        As the design was mostly the same, functionally, as the existing one, most of the changes I made was related to the visual design, and making the product follow the same visual identity as the website.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="heading-3">Icon System</h3>
                    <p class="body-copy">
                        I got to work with something which I had wanted to explore for a while: icons for the web. 
                        I had read a little about the subject, since I used some icons on my personal website, but not enough to warrant the use of a system.
                        So far, I had just used inline SVGs, which kind of bothered me, since they were tedious to keep track of and reuse.
                        But on FlyFotos WebGIS, I had the opportunity to explore the topic of icon systems some more, since I had to create a bunch of icons which should be easy for the developer to implement.
                        I decided on implementing an icon font, which seemed to me to check the aforementioned criterion. 
                        I know of some other approach, were you create one main SVG with all the icons, which you refer to in the HTML, but I wasn’t too sold on the idea.
                        An icon font system seemed slick and easy to implement, so I was very eager to dive into it.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="heading-3">Icon Fonts</h3>
                    <p class="body-copy">
                        The idea behind an icon font is pretty clever. You create a custom font, where each glyph represents an icon. 
                        Then you can simply write the code for the specific glyph (icon) you want to use, or you can use some CSS magic to make classes for each icon. 
                        Doing the latter, you just have to make a span element (or I element, although not recommended because of the semantics related to it), and give it the corresponding class.
                        You also get icons which are easy to style, and to size. 
                        Since the icon is practically a font, you can use the font-size CSS property to set its size. 
                        Similarly, you can use the color property to color it. No more fill or stroke for styling an SVG.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="heading-3">Iconmoon</h3>
                    <p class="body-copy">
                        In order to make the process of creating an icon font simpler, there are some different tools. 
                        I chose the first one I came across, Iconmoon, which seemed to worked fine (other than the fact that you have to give your icon’s CSS classes a prefix, and I had already given my files that. My first icons turned out like icon-icon-name).
                        Using iconmoon, I just had to export my icons from my design system in Figma, upload them to iconmoon, make some adjustments and download the font. 
                        Then the font file and CSS stylesheet can be linked in the HTML, and the icons are ready to use.

                    <h2 class="heading-3">Desiging for Business Goals</h2>
                    <p class="body-copy">
                        Following the first week, I had the design down in broad strokes, so I quickly turned my focus to how the design could support the business goals.

                        At the time, there was a consensus that there were three types of customers - private, company and private premium. 

                        You can use the product without an account, as long as you are a private person. Instead of paying for the product, you would be shown advertisements.
                        The premium users on the other hand, would get rid of the ads, and unlock more features.
                        Lastly, the B2B customers would have to pay in order to get an account, based on the number of users within the company.

                        Early on, I tried to support these three types of customers, but somewhere during me last two weeks, I had become sceptical of the second type of customer.

                        I suddenly had a hard time imagining that a private person would use the product so extensively, that they would want to create an account.

                        The small amount of potential customers in this segment, together with the costs of getting up a payment service, seemed to outweigh the potential income.

                        In the end, the design for making an account focused solely on B2B customers and free to use for private customers (with ads).

                    <h3 class="heading-3">Demo</h3>
                    <p class="body-copy">
                        The second to last friday of my internship, I held an online demo, showing my work to all of my colleagues, who in turn had the opportunity to comment on the design.
                        The demo was held online, over Teams and took 30 minutes.
                        There was some good, actionable feedback, which prompted some changes to the design, relating to the consistency of icons and the conceptual model of how the search function should work.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="heading-3">Design Document</h3>
                    <p class="body-copy">
                        The remaining week, I spend working on some other projects, as well as tidying up the design document, so it was ready to handover to the developer.
                    </p>

                    <p class="body-copy">
                        At I-GIS they do a lot of consultanting and support work on a daily basis, and their consultants have backgrounds in geology or geophysics.
                        The fact that they have highly domain specific knowledge and interact with their customers on a daily basis, informs the way they think when they build their software - they think in therms of what the users want to accomplish.
                        I found that they are aware of some of the usability issues in their products, but that they have to prioritise their work efforts, since they are a small company.
                        The usability of their products could definitely be improved, and their developers are also aware of possible improvements.
                        But at the end of the day, they have to prioritise where to put their efforts.
                    </p>
