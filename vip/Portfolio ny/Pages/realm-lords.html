                    <h2 class="heading-2">The Project</h2>
                    <p class="body-copy">
                        “Think Hearthstone, but three players against one”. That is roughly how the game was pitched to me by my soon-to-be game producer. Even for a prototype, this was a very ambitious project even without considering the two months deadline. But we were a bunch of motivated people with some freetime during the summer, and a big interest in games.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="heading-3">The Team</h3>
                    <p class="body-copy">
                        Considering the scope of the project, the team was quite small. Aside from the game producer, we were two sub teams. The programming team, consisting of a UI programmer, three backend programmers, and one networking programmer. On the other team, the art team, we had two UI artists as well as one concept artist, and myself as UI designer and team lead. Music & sound effects were going to be covered by someone outside our team. Our level of skill ranged from novice to mere seasoned, but all of us were excited to work with each other and further our skills.

                    <h3 class="heading-3">The Goal</h3>
                    <p class="body-copy">
                        Of course the underlying goal of the project was to deliver a playable prototype of a card game, but there was a different, underlying goal. From the very beginning, our producer made it clear that the motivation behind was making an environment where each of us could improve on our respective skillsets. Making the prototype was just a means toward that end - getting a sense of how it is to work as a team to deliver a game within a set deadline. The project was not intended to become anything more than what we could do during the two months, but we did aim for releasing a playable prototype on the itch.io games platform.

                    <h2 class="heading-2">My Role</h2>
                    <p class="body-copy">
                        I had two main responsibilities. As the UI designer, I had to figure out the best way to communicate game information to players, using graphics and sound. As the art lead on the other hand, I had to define the aesthetic vision of the game together with the rest of the team, and I had to make sure that we could deliver. This meant I had to understand the capabilities and personal goals of my team members, and use these as constraints for the vision of the game. 
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="heading-3">The Challenges</h3>
                    <p class="body-copy">
                        We lacked an artist to work on the in game environment, with aspects such as lighting, 3D modelling and 2D textures, which make up a big part of the game’s visual appeal. Apart from that, we only had one concept artist to work and the art for the around 80 distinct cards in the game (he actually managed to make all of the cards!). This made it a challenge to deliver something polished, with a visual appeal. Our solution was to leverage our lack of resources and make the game’s aesthetic around the what we had.

                    <h2 class="heading-2">The Creative Process</h2>
                    <p class="body-copy">
                        I like to think about design (and creative processes in general) as working with different constraints. By constraints, I mean the underlying considerations which inform the direction of the design. As an example, when trying to implement a new diet, you might think about nutrition, affordability and time, as the main factors determining what might be an acceptable choice. Identifying these parameters helps by narrowing down the problemspace. Since constraints are sometimes conflicting (which is common in creative processes), finding the right balance requires strategic consideration and a lot of trial on error. I find that the best way to work with constraints is to first identify as many as possible and then work as abstract and quickly as possible, going through different  ideas - different configurations of how the constraints might be fulfilled. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="body-copy">
                        What makes constraints useful is also what makes them hard to work with. The sacrifice of going from the abstract towards the concrete is that you deselect the other possibilities. If you then discover a new constraint, you might already have said goodbye to all the possible ways to satisfy it, and you have to go back. In the context of this project, screenspace was one of the main constraining factors. This was something I had to be aware of from the very beginning. I had to make sure I knew all the rules of the game which had to be conveyed graphically, so that I could allocate the adequate space for it in the design (each of them a constraint on their own). More than once, it happened that I was unaware of a rule which had to be conveyed, and I had to adjust the design accordingly. Sometimes this meant I had to scrap a previous design for UI component, since there was no longer space for it. The silver lining here is that in working with any creative endeavour, it is useful to work from the abstract to the concrete, and not put too much effort into early designs. Instead, early designs should be used as quick tools to explore the problemspace and uncover the underlying constraints.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="heading-3">Example: Player Resources</h3>
                    <p class="body-copy">
                        One example of this is when I was considering how to represent the players’ resources - mana and health. I had the idea going with the style of gothic RPGs and use orbs to which contained a liquid and a number, both telling the player how much mana or health they have. It all started out according to the textbook, sketching on paper at first. Then I started elaborating the design in Figma, and exploring how to represent “shared mana” - one of the game’s novelty rules. After a good amount of time and creating different designs, I realised that the idea was inherently flawed. In gothic RPGs, mana and health is typically counted in the hundreds, thousands and even millons. In our game, we only had to work with a range of perhaps 0 to 40. In the case of mana, starting from two. I had broken a constraint which might be thought of as “the graphical representation of player resources should make sense in the context of the range of numbers”.
