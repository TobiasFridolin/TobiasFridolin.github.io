                <h2>Hi!</h2>
            
                <div>    
                    <p>
                        Hi. My name is Tobey.  I have a passion for making beautiful digital experiences and digital products enjoyable to use.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have a cand.scient. in interaction design from Aalborg University.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In my spare time I enjoy being out in nature, baking sourdoughs, making music, and playing games with friends and family.            
                    </p>
                </div>

           <h2>What I do</h2>

           <div>

                <p>
                    The user-centered design philosophy is at the heart of what I do. 
                    Exploring and communicating alternative designs and creating detailed user interfaces is what I enjoy the most. 
                    The ‘aha’ moments of discovering how other people work and interact with digital products, and seeing how your prototype holds up in action is, to me, what keeps it interesting
                </p>

            </div>

           <h2>What is interaction design?</h2>

           <div>

                <p>
                    Interaction design is very much about learning. 
                    Learning about people so you can design products which align with how they perceive, understand and behave in the context of use.
                </p>
